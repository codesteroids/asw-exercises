Exercise 3 using a Javascript Framework

##EXERCISE #3

To open a trial account in our system, the user must enter at least the following information: first and last name, email address (important that it is entered correctly otherwise the registration process does not go through without the user receives any feedback) and declare to accept the platform’s conditions of use.
Since the data entered at the registration's time are the only ones accessible to our marketing / sales service it would also be convenient for us to have: the company name (for non-private users), a telephone number and the address.
We should then prevent the registration form from being abused by programs (spam / brute force attacks).

Draw an optimal form that takes into account the desires of the potential clients (who wants to test our application with the minimum effort) and of our marketing (which instead would like as much data as possible).

Result: HTML file with any resources (CSS, …)
