# Exercise 01 - Bootstrap

This version of the exercise leverages the power of **bootstrap** to create fluid layouts.

This exercise uses **Webpack** helping in the automation of changes and processing **sass** stylesheets.

If you like to test and play around with the code, you need to `cd` into this folder and the run the following command first:

`npm install`

after that you have 2 more commands you can use:

* `npm run dev` - creates a dev server with live reload to test changes on the spot
* `npm run build` - packages and ships the build into the `dist` folder

If you just want to see the build in action, please load the `index.html` file located inside the `dist` folder.
